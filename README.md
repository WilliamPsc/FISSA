# FISSA: Fault Injection Simulation for Security Assessment
## Building Fault Injection Scenarios with Ease
---
### Description
FISSA is a tool designed for generating fault injection campaigns in micro-architectures, essential for assessing the security of designs against physical attacks. By deliberately introducing hardware errors into the micro-architecture of processors, FISSA allows users to test their robustness against potential hardware failures.
This open-source tool integrates with existing simulation environment like Questasim, streamlining the process of generating fault injection scenarios.

With FISSA, generating fault injection campaigns becomes more accessible, empowering users to assess the security and reliability of their designs efficiently to enable *Security By Design*.

---
### Installation
#### Setting up python environment
To run FISSA, ensure you have Python 3.10.12 (or more) installed on your system. If needed, you can set up a virtual environment using your preferred method. You can check this documentation if you need : [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

After setting up the Python environment, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt    
```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to use FISSA for generating fault injection campaigns in micro-architectures.

##### Preliminaries
This `README.md` is part of the [repository](git@git@github.com:WilliamPsc/FISSA.git) and should sit in the `FISSA` directory. If it is not, please clone the repository first:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:WilliamPsc/FISSA.git FISSA
cd FISSA
```

At this point, you can define your installation and working directory:
```bash
export FISSA=$pwd
```
If you run `ls $FISSA`, it should return the content of the `FISSA` folder.

### Integrating your design inside FISSA

#### Generator


#### Integration with HDL Simulator


#### Analyser

---
### Getting started
#### Running FISSA
First, you need to go in the ```FISSA/app/``` folder and then from this folder you will be able to run the \_\_init\_\_.py file.
Execute these commands in FISSA main folder:
```bash
cd $FISSA/app/
python3 __init__.py
```

You will have a contextual menu in which you will have to choose the protection you want to use. Then, the next menu will be to choose if you want to generate TCL files, analyse JSON files or just compute the number of simulations to be generated by the generator (first choice).
The picture below shows this contextual menu with the different choice implemented by default.

After you pressed `ENTER`, the command will be executed with the aforementionned protection.

### Features
Users can easily define parameters such as threat models, attack windows, and registers to be attacked via configuration files, simplifying the testing process. FISSA also provides reporting functions for analysing results, and it generates TCL scripts compatible with various simulation tools.

#### Clock period

#### Maximum number of cycles

#### Number of simulations per file

#### Number of simulation's batch

#### Paths

#### Targets defined in configuration file

#### Fault models
By default, seven fault models are defined. These fault models are:
- __set0__ : set a target to '0 during half a clock period.
- __set1__ : set a target to '1 during half a clock period.
- __bitflip__ : set a target to '0 during half a clock period.
- __single_bitflip_spatial__
- __single_bitflip_temporel__
- __multi_bitflip_reg__
- __multi_bitflip_reg_multi__

---
### Example


---
### Roadmap

- Adding more fault models
- Adding more protections types
- Adding a solution to detect every registers or signals in a set of HDL code
- Integrate small solutions developed in `app/tools/`
- Add more configurability to reduce integration
- Supporting more HDL simulators (Vivado, Verilator, ...)
- Code optimisation
- Enhance code readability
- Enhance integration into the design workflow by adding functionalities
- Development of a graphical user interface
