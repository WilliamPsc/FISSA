# FISSA: Fault Injection Simulation for Security Assessment

## Building Fault Injection Scenarios with Ease
---
### Abstract
Microarchitecture fault injection has become an essential tool for assessing the reliability of modern computer systems against physical attacks. This technique involves deliberately introducing hardware errors into the micro-architecture of a processor or embedded system in order to test its robustness against potential hardware failures. This approach has become crucial in the current context where system reliability is a major issue. The creation of an open source tool for generating fault injection campaigns in the micro-architecture is becoming essential. Generating scenarios to simulate fault injections can be tedious. This tool would allow users to easily define parameters (e.g. threat model, attack window, registers to be attacked) and config files for their tests, simplifying the process. Configuration files could be used to specify the type of errors, their location and other criteria, while reporting functions would simplify analysis of the results. The tool presented would allow parameters to be used to generate a TCL script for various simulation tools (e.g. Modelsim/Questasim, Vivado, ...).
